FakeM has also included HTML code in C2 traffic in an apparent attempt to evade detection. Additionally, some variants of FakeM use modified SSL code for communications back to C2 servers, making SSL decryption ineffective.[1]"}, {"score": 1, "techniqueID": "T1001", "comment": "FakeM C2 traffic attempts to evade detection by resembling data generated by legitimate messenger applications, such as MSN and Yahoo! messengers.[1]"}, {"score": 1, "techniqueID": "T1056", "comment": "FakeM contains a keylogger module.[1]"}, {"score": 1, "techniqueID": "T1071", "comment": "Some variants of FakeM use SSL to communicate with C2 servers.[1]"}, {"score": 1, "techniqueID": "T1032", "comment": "Some variants of FakeM use RC4 to encrypt C2 traffic.[1]"}], "gradient": {"colors": ["#ffffff", "#66b1ff"], "minValue": 0, "maxValue": 1}, "legendItems": [{"label": "used by FakeM", "color": "#66b1ff"}]}
